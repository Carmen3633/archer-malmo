	<h2>The Introduction to the field trip</h2>
	<div class="toptext"><p>The this field is going on a tour to downtown Memphis to a web design and many other branch company called Archer Malmo. The main lobby of the area is pretty big, we were introduced to Greg who was our tour guide for the time being. The man lobby was the Cotton Museum and it was really niced. </p></div>

	<div class="textbox"><P>On the tour, we mainly stayed where we started, our tour guide told us some stuff about Archer Malmo and what they do, and also what the team do. A long explanation about what he do and what others do. They have a huge whiteboard with all the projects they should be doing. Like one of them, Ian, was out and had an after project with him after his baby.We went to different rooms inside the company so we could get an idea of what we might want to do. We met another guy named Michael in the commercial section of the company. </P></div>

	<h2>Cookout</h2>
	<p>For the ending of this trip, we went out to eat a fast food chain called Cookout. I sat with a four others, Naomi, Jordan, and some other dude. I ordered a chicken sandwhich,quesidilla, and some fries and a milkshake. All of those are in total of $11 plus tax. We spend there for a good hour or less. We four sat at the table talking about some really relatable things, like taking a dump in school or public toilet, or how we be drinking almost a full waterbottle of water when we wake up in the middle of night.  The thing I liked about CookOut is the food, it's not too bad and not too good. It's basically you get what your money is worth The milshshake was really good and tasted homemade. </p>
